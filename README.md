# TargetBridge

Apple dropped Target Display Mode in late 2014 with the 5K iMac — and it never came back.

TargetBridge brings it back via software, streaming your screen at up to 5K over a direct Thunderbolt connection, e.g. to an iMac.

It's free and open source software, no subscription and no dongle required.

## Features

- a sender can stream either an extended virtual display or a mirror of the sender display
- one sender can stream to multiple receiver machines (using multiple TB cables)
- multiple available stream profiles from 2560x1440 to 5120x2880 at various refresh rates
- uses low latency, high throughput thunderbolt connections
- uses Apple Silicon Media Engines for fast H.264/HEVC encoding
- automatic receiver discovery via Bonjour
- remembers extended-display arrangement per receiver

## Requirements

- Sender: Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or later), macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Receiver: Intel or Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 11 Big Sur or later
- Thunderbolt cable
- see also [Hardware.md](docs/Hardware.md) for more hardware information

## Download

**[→ Download latest release (pre-built apps, no Xcode needed)](https://github.com/swellweb/targetBridge/releases/latest)**

- `TargetBridge-arm64.app.zip` — Sender (for Apple Silicon Macs)
- `TargetBridge-Receiver-arm64.app.zip` — Apple Silicon Receiver (use machine as monitor for sender)
- `TargetBridge-Receiver-x86_64.app.zip` — Intel Receiver (use machine as monitor for sender)

Unzip and double-click. On first launch, grant Screen Recording permission to the sender.

If you build from source, app outputs go into `build/` folder.

> **"App is damaged" warning?** macOS quarantines unsigned apps downloaded from the browser. Run this in Terminal, then try again:

> xattr -cr ~/Downloads/TargetBridge-Receiver-x86_64.app
> ```

## Extended Desktop

For an extended desktop, choose `Extended display` on the sender before connecting. After the virtual display appears, open macOS **System Settings → Displays → Arrange** on the sender Mac and position the external display where you want it. TargetBridge now reuses the last saved extended-display position for the same receiver when possible.

If the receiver does not fill the iMac panel or the cursor/desktop feels scaled incorrectly, select the external TargetBridge display in macOS Display Settings and choose the matching resolution. For the 27-inch 5K iMac path, use a high-clarity stream profile such as `Crisp` or `5K` with the external display set to the matching 2560 × 1440 HiDPI mode.
